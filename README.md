# fendull

Welcome viewers of [https://twitch.tv/fendull](https://twitch.tv/fendull)! This repository is host to a bunch of services that run fendull's stream and community. 

## Services

- [Website]()
- [Twitchbot (notfendull)]()
- [Song Request Service]()
- [Programming Challenges Service]()
- [Fendull Ticket Service]()
- More to come?


## High level overview

While the stream is the main point of interaction for viewers, [fendull.com](https://fendull.com) and its related services are intended to expand upon the viewing experience. One of the basic integrations to any stream is a Twitchbot (usually StreamElements or NightBot). Here we've built our own bot, notfendull, whose feature set is slowly growing. Because we built him from scratch, it gives us the opportunity to integrate chat with all other fendull services.


Fendull also enjoys playing piano on stream, so we intend to build a songlist system similar to StreamerSongList, however with a few more features that tailor to fendull's piano experience and goals. 


Lastly, the main goal of streaming for fendull is help viewers learn programming in a fun and interactive way. The Programming Challenges Service will enable fendull.com to host quizzes, programming challenges, and programming tutorials that can take a viewer from no programming experience to entry-level software developer ready. Of course, the curation of teaching material will take a long time, but that's part of the journey, isn't it?


In, addition, I intend to create a ticketing service that serves as a currency of sorts for fendull's stream. An example of using tickets would be making or promoting a song request. Hopefully we find better incentives for earning tickets than just that. Tickets will probably be converted from stream points but also earned from completing programming challenges, or contributing to this repository.
